You must design a secure communication protocol to be used to send messages on Snap‚Äôs internal network. This protocol must be such that the messages are fully encrypted.

The encryption rules are as follows:

Letter Shifting and Emoticons

Each letter or emoji in the message must be shifted forward in the alphabet by the remainder of dividing the Unicode value of that letter by 5.
If the shift reaches the end of the alphabet or the range of emoticons, it continues to the beginning.
Number Substitution

Each number in the message must be replaced with its Unicode code and then multiplied by the length of the message itself.
For example, if the number 3 is in the message and the length of the message before encryption is 10, the number 3 is replaced with its Unicode code (51) and then multiplied by 10, resulting in 510.
The length of the message is the number of characters in it.
Whitespace Conversion

Each whitespace must be converted to the underscore _ by the number of characters in the word before it.
For example, if there is a word with 5 letters before the space, that space will be converted to _____.
Reversing the message

The final message after applying all the above rules should be printed in reverse (except for numbers).
Note: These apply to any message in the same way.

You need to write a program that takes a message as input, encrypts it according to the above rules, and prints the result.

Note
It is guaranteed that only uppercase and lowercase English letters, numbers, spaces, and emoticons are included in the expressions.
To better understand emoticons and the required spacing in Unicode, it is recommended to read this link.
Input
First, you receive an integer n, which indicates the number of sentences you are going to receive from the input for encryption.
On the next n lines of input, a sentence comes, which can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and spaces.
Output
Print a string on each line of output that represents the final encrypted message.
